### Project description: 
Explore sound in its basics in virtual reality (VR).
The game is based on the idea of the Easter egg hunt. The player has to look for flowers in the maze, collect three of them and put each of them in a vase. After every vase is filled the player can collect an egg, which is the key to open the door at the end.

### Development platform: 
OS: MacOS BigSur 11, Game Engine: Unity 2019.1.14f1, Visual Studio Code 1.4, Steam,  
SteamVR 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.5.0)

Note on Unity Version 2019.1.14f1 and SteamVR: The SteamVr plugin has many issues when used with Unity Versions > 2019.1.3 because the XR Management System changed from 2019.1.3 to 2019.1.4. Valve is working on it, so we will use these older versions for the VR programming.
